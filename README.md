# APIs-2019

---------> Todo_Project_Web
  This API was focused in develop an API using JEE and all the necessary config to handle REST-API, standing for Servlets, Json config, deployment through Tomcat 7 setting up the config manually using Maven_Build and catalina, Packages necessary in order to be able of Create, See tasks and Delete some tasks, having a domain class called TaskStub. We did not use a DB, we were adding Tasks directly in classes. We did a little front-end in html for the logging and not for endpoints, we were testing with Postman.
  
  This API was supported by Softtek instructor, since the configuration was so tricky, I mean that we were supported by him while taking the course and doing others activities, since we had groups of working and we needed to use git as teamworking activities and merge changes into a main branch.
  
 ---------> Jasso
  This API was focused in develop and API using Spring and this was the finall project, this menas I developed the whole API by my own having a deadline of two weeks, and this was developed after course ended. 
   
  The API is giving the ability of Create tasks, read tasks by category, delete tasks, update status for tasks. I used Spring boot, JPA in the repository and H2 as DB since I wanted that any user were able of run it with any DB config, but just need to stablish the config for DB in the properties file to use either MySQL or Postgres. I stablished packages according the best practices I found and documented it as well. I did not add any front-end because I had no time for it, but have some knowledge with REACT (learned by my own and used in one client), so I used Postman for checking my endpoints, passing parameter directly in Json.
